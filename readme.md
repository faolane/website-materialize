## Description
This repository contains the HTML and CSS codes for my [website](http://www.fabienbrieuc.com).

I used the [Materialize CSS framework](http://materializecss.com/).

I am far from being an expert in HTML or CSS so there might be some mistakes and/or bad practices here and there. So if you see any or anything else that could easily be improved don't hesitate to pull request / notify me.
